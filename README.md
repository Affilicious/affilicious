### Does this affect me as an affiliate marketer? ###
Yes, it does. We are affiliate marketers ourselves and we know that this business can be challenging and expensive at the beginning.
The competition gets bigger and bigger. Having a great foundation for your websites is just essential!

That's exactly where we want to help you. We are providing the foundation with many useful features. The times searching for the 
right plugins and themes are over. If you want to get great plugins and themes, you just have to visit our [official website](https://affilicioustheme.de).

### Why should I care as a developer? ###
Really, there are many reasons! You as a developer can benefit from extending Affilicious by building custom plugins and themes. 
Additionally, the affiliate marketing community is growing fast and needs many individual plugins to manage their websites. I'm sure that there are 
many customers who can't wait to use your plugins and/or themes!

Maybe you are asking how complex it can be to develop something with Affilicious. Well, the answer is: Easy compared to other similar solutions.
You have to know that Affilicious is developed thinking about third party developers and theme authors needs from the beginning.
Here is why developing with the Affilicious Plugin is really fun:

1. Build on top of the [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) platform.
2. The whole architecture is based on [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_Design).
3. [Carbon Fields](https://carbonfields.net) and [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) for building complex forms with ease.
4. [Pimple](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org) as a small Dependency Injection Container.
5. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) for building assets.
6. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [ECMAscript 6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) Support.
7. Lots of build-in Wordpress [Hooks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Hooks) and [Filters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference).
8. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for easy vendor usage. 
9. Automated tests with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de).
